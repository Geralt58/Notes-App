A notes-app used to store notes I made with the help of tutorials online. Uses a few external libraries like dayjs and uuid. The difference between the previous Notes-App-Legacy application and this one is that it is carried over to a webpack package and made with a compatible file structure.

To run the file in your local repository, open the root folder in your terminal and use 'npm install' to install the node modules. Then use 'npm run dev-server' to host the dev server and use 'npm run build' to build the production files.
